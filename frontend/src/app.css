/*
Global CSS Stylesheet.

This file contains CSS rules that apply globally across the entire application.
Use it for base styles, resets, utility classes, CSS variables, font imports, etc.

Avoid putting component-specific styles here. Leverage Svelte's scoped styles
within individual `.svelte` components for better modularity.
