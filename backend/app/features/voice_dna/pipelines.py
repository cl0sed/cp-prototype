Haystack AI Pipeline Definitions for the Voice DNA Feature.

This file defines Haystack pipelines (or similar AI orchestration logic)
specific to the Creator Voice DNA feature.

Examples:
- Pipelines for analyzing text to extract stylistic features.
- Pipelines for generating text in a specific creator's voice.
- Pipelines combining retrieval, generation, and custom components.

Define the structure and components of your AI pipelines here.
Keep the core pipeline definitions separate from the service logic that uses them.
Prompt templates used by these pipelines should typically reside in the `prompts/` directory.
