Background Tasks (SAQ) for the Voice DNA Feature.

This file defines the actual functions that will be executed asynchronously
by the SAQ worker for tasks related to the Creator Voice DNA feature.

Examples:
- A task to run a long-running Voice DNA analysis pipeline.
- A task to periodically update Voice DNA profiles based on new content.
- Tasks interacting with external services that might be slow.

Implement the logic for background jobs here. These functions will be decorated
with `@queue.task` (or similar) and imported in `app/worker/settings.py`.
Tasks should typically call methods from the corresponding feature service (`service.py`)
to perform the actual work, keeping the task definition itself relatively simple.
Ensure tasks are idempotent if possible.
