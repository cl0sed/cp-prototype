"""
Application Logging Configuration.

This file sets up the application's logging, including formatters, handlers,
and log levels for different modules or environments.

Configure standard logging, structured logging (JSON), or integration with
external logging services here.

Avoid putting application logic here. Focus solely on configuring the
logging framework (e.g., Python's built-in logging module).
