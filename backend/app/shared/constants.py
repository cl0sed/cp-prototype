"""
Shared Constants and Enumerations.

This file contains constant values and enumerations (Enums) that are used
across multiple features or modules within the backend application.

Examples:
- Status codes or states (e.g., TaskStatus.PENDING, TaskStatus.COMPLETED).
- Predefined string literals or numerical values with specific meanings.
- Configuration keys if used consistently across modules.

Keep this for truly shared, static values. Avoid putting configuration settings
(which should be in config.py) or feature-specific constants here.
