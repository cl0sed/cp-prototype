Configuration loading using Pydantic Settings.

This file defines Pydantic models that load settings from environment variables,
.env files, or other sources.

It should contain settings related to database connections, external API keys,
application behavior flags, etc.

Do NOT hardcode secrets here. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
Keep this focused only on defining the structure and source of configurations.
