"""
Main FastAPI application entry point.

This file defines the FastAPI application instance, includes routers,
configures middleware, and potentially handles lifespan events (startup/shutdown).

Application-wide settings or configurations that don't belong in config.py
and are directly related to the FastAPI app instance itself can go here.
Avoid putting business logic or specific endpoint implementations in this file;
keep it focused on application assembly.
