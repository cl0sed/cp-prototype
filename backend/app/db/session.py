"""
Database Session Management.

This file configures the SQLAlchemy engine and session handling.
It typically includes:
- Creating the database engine (connecting to the database).
- Defining a SessionLocal factory for creating new database sessions.
- Potentially providing a dependency (e.g., for FastAPI) to get a session
  scoped to a request.

Keep this focused on the mechanics of establishing and providing database
sessions. Avoid defining models or placing query logic here.
