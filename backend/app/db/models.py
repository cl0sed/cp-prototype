"""
Database Models (SQLAlchemy Table Definitions).

This file defines the structure of your database tables using SQLAlchemy ORM models.
Each class typically represents a table, and its attributes represent columns.

Define table names, columns, data types, relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many),
indexes, and constraints here.

Avoid putting query logic or business logic in model files. Keep them focused
strictly on defining the database schema representation.
