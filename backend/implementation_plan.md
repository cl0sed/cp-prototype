# FastAPI Health Endpoint Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for setting up the initial FastAPI application with a basic `/health` endpoint for the AI Video Creation Platform project.

## Requirements

1. Configure the main FastAPI application
2. Create a health response Pydantic model
3. Implement a health endpoint router
4. Ensure the application is runnable via Uvicorn

## Implementation Details

### 1. Update `backend/app/api/schemas.py`

Add a `HealthResponse` Pydantic model to define the health endpoint response:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class HealthResponse(BaseModel):
    status: str
```

This model defines a simple response with a `status` field that will contain a string value.

### 2. Create `backend/app/api/routers/health.py`

Create a router for the health endpoint:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from ..schemas import HealthResponse

router = APIRouter(tags=["Health"])


@router.get("/health", response_model=HealthResponse)
async def health_check() -> HealthResponse:
    """
    Health check endpoint to verify API is running.
    Returns a simple response with status "ok".
    """
    return HealthResponse(status="ok")
```

Key aspects:
- Uses the `APIRouter` with a "Health" tag for organization
- Implements a GET endpoint at `/health`
- Uses the `HealthResponse` model for typing and validation
- Follows async-first approach with `async def`
- Returns an instance of `HealthResponse` with status set to "ok"

### 3. Update `backend/app/main.py`

Configure the FastAPI application and include the health router:

```python
"""
Main FastAPI application entry point.

This file defines the FastAPI application instance, includes routers,
configures middleware, and potentially handles lifespan events (startup/shutdown).

Application-wide settings or configurations that don't belong in config.py
and are directly related to the FastAPI app instance itself can go here.
Avoid putting business logic or specific endpoint implementations in this file;
keep it focused on application assembly.
"""
from fastapi import FastAPI
from .api.routers import health

app = FastAPI(
    title="AI Video Creation Platform API",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="API for managing AI-powered video script creation."
)

# Include routers
app.include_router(health.router)

# Logging configuration will be applied here (using logging_config.py)

# Middleware will be added here

# Lifespan events (startup/shutdown) will be defined here

# Configuration settings (from config.py) will be loaded/used here
```

Key aspects:
- Preserves the original docstring
- Imports the FastAPI class and the health router
- Configures the FastAPI application with title, version, and description
- Includes the health router
- Adds comments for future integrations as specified in the requirements

## Directory Structure Check

Ensure the following directory structure exists (create directories if they don't):
- `backend/app/api/routers/` - Should exist but may be empty

## Testing

After implementation, run the application with:

```bash
cd <project_root>
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

The health endpoint should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/health` and return:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

Additionally, the OpenAPI documentation should be available at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Next Steps

After completing this implementation, the application will have a functioning health endpoint that can be used to verify the API is running correctly. Future enhancements could include:

1. Adding more detailed health information (version, uptime, dependencies status)
2. Implementing additional endpoints for core functionality
3. Setting up logging, middleware, and configuration as indicated by the placeholder comments
