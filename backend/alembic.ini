# Configuration file for Alembic (Database Migration Tool)
#
# This file configures the behavior of the Alembic command-line tool.
#
# Key Sections:
# - [alembic]: Main configuration section.
#   - `script_location`: Path to the directory containing migration scripts (env.py, versions/).
#   - `sqlalchemy.url`: Database connection string (often loaded dynamically in env.py instead).
#   - `file_template`: Naming convention for new migration files.
# - [loggers], [handlers], [formatters]: Standard Python logging configuration for Alembic output.
#
# Configure database connection details (preferably via env.py loading from app config),
# script locations, and migration file naming here.
# Avoid putting sensitive information directly in this file if it's committed to version control.
