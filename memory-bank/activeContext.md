| ## Current Focus
|
| * [2025-04-18 09:28:30] - Rearchitecting the React frontend application with React 19.1, Mantine 7.17.4, and SuperTokens Auth React. We've updated the package.json dependencies, improved the SuperTokens integration to use only supertokens-auth-react, and implemented modern UI components with Mantine 7.17.4. The next steps involve installing the updated dependencies and testing the new implementation.
|
| * [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Implementing authentication using SuperTokens (Task 4a). We've successfully integrated SuperTokens Managed Service for authentication in both the backend and frontend. The implementation includes user sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, session management, and API protection. We've also created a protected dashboard page and updated the API client to handle authentication tokens.
|
| * [2025-04-18 13:14:20] - Troubleshooting SuperTokens frontend redirect issue: App redirects to `/auth/?redirectToPath=%2Fprofile` causing a 404 because no route exists for `/auth` itself, only `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup`.
| * [2025-04-18 15:15:00] - Completed backend code review and implemented refactoring based on findings.
|
| ## Recent Changes
|
* [2025-04-18 16:15:00] - Completed frontend profile/header/logout updates:
  * Backend: Added `username` field to `User` model (DB + migration), added `username` to `UserProfile` API schema.
  * Backend: Updated SuperTokens `sign_up_post` override to save username to DB.
  * Frontend: Profile page displays username, logout button added at bottom-right.
  * Frontend: Header avatar acts as dropdown menu (Profile/Logout links).
  * Frontend: Ensured immediate logout redirection from both profile page and header menu.
  * Frontend: Fixed global CSS (`index.css`) to ensure consistent light background on all pages (including auth).

| * [2025-04-18 13:02:00] - Fixed excessive dev server requests for @tabler/icons-react by adding a Vite alias to force static icon exports (`dist/esm/icons/index.mjs`).

|
| * [2025-04-18 15:35:00] - Optimized development workflow for faster feedback:
|   * Enabled hot-reloading for worker service using `watchfiles`.

| ## Open Questions/Issues
|
| * [2025-04-17 15:13:10] - Consider implementing end-to-end tests for the new authentication flow using Playwright.
| * [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Need to implement the actual agent interaction logic in the `/agent/interact` endpoint (Task 4b).
| * [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Consider adding more advanced authentication features in the future (password reset, email verification, social logins, etc.).
|
| [2025-04-18 13:40:01] - **Current Focus:** Debugging signup failure (400 error, 'too many formFields').
| [2025-04-18 13:45:38] - **Recent Changes:** Identified mismatch between frontend (sending email, password, username) and backend SuperTokens config (expecting only email, password). Applied fix to `backend/app/features/auth/supertokens_config.py` to accept 'username' using `InputFormField` after several tool attempts (`apply_diff` failed, `insert_content` failed due to format, `write_to_file` succeeded).
| [2025-04-18 13:50:04] - **Status:** Signup issue **FIXED**. Backend service requires rebuild/restart (`docker-compose up -d --build backend`) to apply the fix. Signup needs re-testing to confirm.
|
| [2025-04-18 14:30:00] - **Status:** Profile endpoint (`/api/user/profile`) is now functional. Initial 500 errors (SQLAlchemy mapper init, missing DB column) and subsequent 404 error (SuperTokens user sync) have been resolved. Schema updated to return `created_at`.
