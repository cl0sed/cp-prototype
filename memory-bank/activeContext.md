## Current Focus

* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Implementing authentication using SuperTokens (Task 4a). We've successfully integrated SuperTokens Managed Service for authentication in both the backend and frontend. The implementation includes user sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, session management, and API protection. We've also created a protected dashboard page and updated the API client to handle authentication tokens.

## Recent Changes

* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Added SuperTokens dependency to backend and frontend.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Updated User model to include supertokens_user_id field.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Created SuperTokens configuration module in backend/app/features/auth/.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Implemented async-compatible user linking between SuperTokens and our database.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Created protected /agent/interact endpoint with session verification.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Created frontend authentication UI using SuperTokens pre-built components.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Updated API client to handle authentication tokens.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Added login/logout functionality to the main layout.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Created protected dashboard page that requires authentication.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Documented authentication architecture in Memory Bank.

## Open Questions/Issues

* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - TypeScript errors in the frontend due to missing type definitions for SuperTokens. These are expected since we haven't installed the dependencies yet. In a real project, we would run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Need to implement the actual agent interaction logic in the `/agent/interact` endpoint (Task 4b).
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Need to test the authentication flow with real users once the dependencies are installed.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Consider adding more advanced authentication features in the future (password reset, email verification, social logins, etc.).
