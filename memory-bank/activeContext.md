# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

## Current Focus

* Refactoring chat features to use Haystack Agent and implement LLM-based greetings.
* Updating documentation and Memory Bank to reflect recent changes and postponed tasks.
* Implementing remaining AI Core features (tools, Human-in-Loop, error handling).
* Implementing remaining Frontend Interface features (Human-in-Loop UI).
* Implementing Background Processing tasks (YT ingestion).
* Implementing Basic Creator DNA Tool Logic.
* Defining & Manually Testing PoC End-to-End Flow.
* Implementing Frontend UI Enhancements (Flowbite types, E2E auth tests).

## Recent Changes

* [2025-04-20 19:30:00] - Debugging: Resolved `TypeError: build_chat_pipeline() got an unexpected keyword argument 'override_pipeline_tag'` by correcting the import path for `build_chat_pipeline` in `chat_service.py`.
* [2025-04-20 19:30:00] - Debugging: Resolved `ValidationError` in `/history` endpoint by aligning `ChatMessageResponse` schema types (UUID, datetime) with ORM model types.
* [2025-04-20 19:30:00] - Debugging: Resolved `AttributeError: 'SecretStr' object has no attribute 'resolve_value'` during LLM generator initialization by wrapping the SecretStr API key in Haystack's `Secret.from_token()`.
* [2025-04-20 19:30:00] - Debugging: Resolved `TypeError: Agent.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'llm'` by using the correct keyword argument `chat_generator` when instantiating the Agent.
* [2025-04-20 19:30:00] - Debugging: Resolved `ValueError: ToolInvoker requires at least one tool.` by providing the `general_tools` list to the Agent constructor.
* [2025-04-20 19:30:00] - Debugging: Resolved `TypeError: cannot pickle 'module' object` by removing the unpicklable `UserService` instance from the pipeline input data.
* [2025-04-20 19:30:00] - Debugging: Resolved `ValueError: Input user not found in component agent.` by explicitly defining the Agent's `state_schema` to include `user` and `session_id` and correctly structuring the input data for the pipeline run method.
* [2025-04-20 18:57:00] - Refactored chat pipeline (`chat_pipeline.py`) to use Haystack Agent.
* [2025-04-20 18:57:00] - Implemented LLM-based greeting generation in `/greeting` endpoint (`chat.py`).
* [2025-04-20 14:47:19] - Completed Model Refactoring and Initial Database Migration: Refactored models into atomic files, updated application imports, resolved circular dependencies using `use_alter=True`, and added `pgvector` extension activation via `env.py` hook. Successfully generated and applied the initial schema migration.
* [2025-04-19 20:45:58] - Debugged Chat Endpoint Errors (422/500): Traced errors to `PromptService` dependency failure due to `prompts.yaml` missing in the backend container.
* [2025-04-20 07:56:49] - Fixed critical DI violation in `backend/app/api/routers/chat.py`, extracted DB logic to `UserService`, and revisited Haystack Pipeline Dependencies.
* [2025-04-19 10:35:00] - Implemented the core structure for the minimal chat interface (backend API, service, Haystack/Portkey integration, frontend UI components/routing).
* [2025-04-19 12:48:28] - Resolved chat interface errors, implemented `PortkeyChatGenerator`, and updated pipeline/ChatService for Haystack/Portkey integration.
* [2025-04-20 12:20:00] - Resolved Pydantic `NameError` during chat router startup.
* [2025-04-19 20:11:20] - Debugged Chat Functionality (422 Errors): Fixed `/api/api/...` routing, addressed SQLAlchemy warnings, fixed `NameError`, and simplified dependency output.
* [2025-04-18 16:15:00] - Completed frontend profile/header/logout updates (including backend changes for username display and saving).
* [2025-04-18 09:28:30] - Completed React frontend rearchitecture with React 19.1, Mantine 7.17.4, and SuperTokens Auth React.
* [2025-04-17 12:35:00] - Implemented basic user authentication using SuperTokens.
* [2025-04-18 15:15:00] - Standardized user not found error handling and created `get_required_user_from_session` dependency.
* [2025-04-18 15:10:00] - Centralized `APP_BASE_URL` in `config.py`.
* [2025-04-18 15:24:00] - Removed redundant frontend auth code.
* [2025-04-18 15:35:00] - Optimized development workflow (worker hot-reloading, removed redundant npm install).
* [2025-04-20 09:38:37] - Implemented prompt and tool versioning strategy.
* [2025-04-20 09:05:37] - Adopted Python subdirectory/module + `__init__.py` re-export pattern for `backend/app/shared/`.
* [2025-04-20 12:51:53] - Standardized test data management using `factory-boy`.
* [2025-04-20 18:42:25] - Successfully removed the `GeneratedStructure` model and all its references from the codebase and database schema via manual migration.
* [2025-04-20 18:42:25] - Resolved database migration issues by manually dropping foreign key constraints and the `generated_structures` table.
* [2025-04-20 18:42:25] - Fixed `TypeError` in `chat_service.py` related to the Haystack `ChatMessage` constructor.
* [2025-04-20 18:42:25] - Noted a potential unresolved issue where the application cannot find a database user for a valid SuperTokens session ID; status pending verification after recent fixes.

## Open Questions/Issues

* Verify overall application functionality and user lookup after recent fixes.
* Implement database model unit tests (postponed).
* Complete Documentation & Cleanup based on the refactor plan (Phase 5).
* Manually perform the E2E test (9b) once all other PoC tasks are complete.
* Begin planning for Early MVP tasks based on the Implementation Plan.
