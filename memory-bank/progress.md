## Next Steps

* Verify overall application functionality and user lookup after recent fixes.
* Implement database model unit tests (postponed).
* Complete Documentation & Cleanup based on the refactor plan (Phase 5).
* Manually perform the E2E test (9b) once all other PoC tasks are complete.
* Begin planning for Early MVP tasks based on the Implementation Plan.
* Implementing remaining AI Core features (tools, Human-in-Loop, error handling).
* Implementing remaining Frontend Interface features (Human-in-Loop UI).
* Implementing Background Processing tasks (YT ingestion).
